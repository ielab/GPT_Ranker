"In semiotics, linguistics, sociology and anthropology, context refers to those objects or entities which surround a focal event, in these disciplines typically a communicative event, of some kind. Context is ""a frame that surrounds the event and provides resources for its appropriate interpretation"". [1]: 2–3 It is thus a relativistic concept, only definable with respect to some focal event, not independently. Contents [ hide ]1 In linguistics2 In linguistic anthropology3 Contextual variables4 See also5 References In linguistics [ edit]Verbal context refers to the text or speech surrounding an expression (word, sentence, or speech act ). Verbal context influences the way an expression is understood; hence the norm of not citing people out of context. Since much contemporary linguistics takes texts, discourses, or conversations as the object of analysis, the modern study of verbal context takes place in terms of the analysis of discourse structures and their mutual relationships, for instance the coherence relation between sentences. Traditionally, in sociolinguistics, social contexts were defined in terms of objective social variables, such as those of class, gender, age or race. More recently, social contexts tend to be defined in terms of the social identity being construed and displayed in text and talk by language users. Influenced by space. The influence of context parameters on language use or discourse is usually studied in terms of language variation, style or register (see Stylistics ). The basic assumption here is that language users adapt the properties of their language use (such as intonation, lexical choice, syntax, and other aspects of formulation) to the current communicative situation. In this sense, language use or discourse may be called more or less 'appropriate' in a given context. It is the language or derigitave terms surrounding set paragraph, novel or article. In linguistic anthropology [ edit]In the theory of sign phenomena, adapted from that of Charles Sanders Peirce, which forms the basis for much contemporary work in linguistic anthropology, the concept of context is integral to the definition of the index, one of the three classes of signs comprising Peirce's second trichotomy. An index is a sign which signifies by virtue of ""pointing to"" some component in its context, or in other words an indexical sign is related to its object by virtue of their co-occurrence within some kind of contextual frame. [2]Contextual variables [ edit]Communicative systems presuppose contexts that are structured in terms of particular physical and communicative dimensions, for instance time, location, and communicative role.

What Is Medical Dosimetry? If you want to work with high-tech medical equipment and contribute to the treatment of patients with cancer, you might train to work in the field of medical dosimetry. Medical dosimetrists determine the proper radiation dosage used in treating cancer patients. Read on to learn more about medical dosimetry and what it takes to work in the field. Schools offering Cardiovascular Technology degrees can also be found in these popularchoices . Medical Dosimetry Medical dosimetry is a part of the field of radiation oncology involving knowledge of advanced mathematics, radiobiology, physics and anatomy. In order to shrink or eliminate tumor growth, some patients receive limited doses of radiation internally or externally. In medical dosimetry, you calculate the amount of these doses and establish the optimal treatment location on a patient's body. Important Facts About This Occupation Median Salary (Sept. 2015) $65,485*Key Skills Attention to detail, stamina to stand on feet for long periods, strength to position patients, interpersonal skills Job Outlook (2012-2022) 24% growth**Licensing Requirements Most states require licensing as a radiation therapist; requirements vary Source: *Pay Scale.com, **U. S. Bureau of Labor Statistics Medical Applications If you choose to work in this field, you'll collaborate with medical physicists and radiation oncologists to determine the amount of radiation used to treat a patient's tumor. Your work will usually take place in a hospital, clinic or private practice cancer center. You'd be responsible for calculating the precise volume of a patient's tumor and the treatment location. You may often use computers, advanced medical imaging and other technology to determine the optimal dose of radiation to shrink a tumor while avoiding damage to healthy tissue and organs. Other Related Tasks Some patients may need immobilization devices in order to ensure they won't move while receiving treatment in a specific area. Because treatments are usually given in a series of sessions, immobilization devices make certain that patients receive treatment in the same location every time. In these cases, you may need to assist in the casting of molds and placing of patient-specific restraints. It's also important that you monitor and record a patient's total amount of exposure to radiation over time. Education Required In order to qualify for training in medical dosimetry, you'll need a good understanding of the physical sciences. There are several options for training programs, including a 4-year baccalaureate degree. If you already have a bachelor's degree in a related field, you can complete a 1- to 2-year graduate certificate. Some schools also offer a master's degree option in medical dosimetry.
